# 🎬 MalluFlix – Malayalam Movie Catalog Addon for Stremio

MalluFlix is a lightweight **Malayalam-only discovery addon** for Stremio.
It uses TMDB for identifying Malayalam films and Cinemeta for official Stremio-compatible metadata, allowing other streaming addons to automatically attach available streams.

> **MalluFlix does NOT host, store, or distribute any video content.**
